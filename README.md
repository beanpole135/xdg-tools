# xdg-tools
Simple C++ tools for adhering to the FreeDesktop.org standards.

## Why are these needed?
The tools released by the FreeDesktop.org group are getting more and more dependent on a Linux or GTK/GNOME toolchain, rendering an extremely large dependency overhead simply for moving files around or verifying the validity of particular text-based files.These tools are designed to be simple, straightforward, and light to make it easy for application developers or package frameworks to ensure that the system adheres to the current standards without a lot of fuss. 

## Licensing
Keeping with the lightweight/open nature of these tools, they are all released under the 2-clause BSD license so anybody (application developers and businesses included) can bundle/modify/use these tools as they see fit for their utilities to ensure proper compliance with the FreeDesktop.org standards.
